# Time-analysis and forcasting-
Using the library
1. Run `pip install flood-forecast`
2. Detailed info on training models can be found on the [Wiki](https://flow-forecast.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FF/pages/364019713/Training+Models).
3. Check out our [Confluence Documentation](https://flow-forecast.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FF/overview) 

The time module can be used to measure the execution time of a code block, convert between different time representations, and sleep for a specified amount of time, but it is not designed specifically for time series forecasting. For time series forecasting, you may want to use specialized libraries such as pandas, numpy, statsmodels, or prophet in Python.
